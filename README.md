# MathForge
MathForge is an extensible symbolic mathematics engine designed to explore algebraic manipulation, symbolic differentiation/integration, expression rewriting, equation solving, and rule‑based transformation.
Unlike numerical solvers, MathForge operates on symbolic structures such as expressions, functions, operators, and transformations—similar to Maple, Mathematica, or SymPy, but built from scratch with a modular and hackable architecture suitable for research, teaching, and language‑model‑assisted reasoning.


MathForge 是一个开源的符号计算推导引擎，灵感来自 Maple / Mathematica / SymPy。
它支持符号表达式树、代数化简、求导/求积、方程求解、符号替换、重写规则、函数展开与变换等，并提供插件化规则系统。
项目目标是在现代编程语言下打造一个可扩展、可研究、可由大模型驱动的数学计算核心。
